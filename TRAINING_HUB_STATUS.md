## üöß Partially Complete

### Numeric Verification
- [x] Numeric detection in UI
- [x] Warning messages when numbers detected
- [x] Policy explanation panel
- [x] Prevent accept without verification
- [x] Server-side regex detection and auto-flagging
- [ ] Evidence span validation (contains exact number)

### Evidence Attachment

### Quality Metrics
- [x] Quality score display
- [x] Claim coverage display  
- [x] Numeric flags display
- [x] Auto claim extraction (server-side)
- [x] Auto claim-to-evidence matching
- [x] Quality tier calculation algorithm

## ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented

### Critical Missing Features
- [x] **Automated server-side checks** (per spec line 180-188):
  - [x] Claim extraction on POST /api/query
  - [x] Number detection regex
  - [x] Auto-claim coverage calculation
  - [x] Quality score composite metric
  - [x] Numeric auto-flag

- [x] **Document viewer** with:
  - [x] PDF page thumbnails sidebar
  - [x] Canvas-based image rendering
  - [x] Text search with highlighting
  - [x] Page navigation and zoom controls
  - [x] Selected evidence highlighting
  - [x] OCR text display and selection

- [ ] **Bulk actions implementation**:
  - [ ] Actually execute bulk accept/reject
  - [ ] Bulk tagging
  - [ ] Validation before bulk accept

### Nice-to-Have / Future
- [ ] Undo implementation (currently just shows UI)
- [ ] Ticket modal for "Send to Dev"
- [ ] Measurement instruction replacements
- [ ] Negative examples for reranker triples
- [ ] Quality score filtering in export
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Auto-refresh inbox
- [ ] Real-time collaboration

## üìã Acceptance Criteria Status

From spec line 237-243:

- [x] Can review & Accept a training example in ‚â§ 60s ‚úì
- [x] Exported JSONL is valid ‚úì
- [x] Exported JSONL includes evidence spans ‚úì
- [~] Numeric verification prevents unverified numbers (UI only, not server-enforced)
- [x] Inbox surfaces highest impact items (quality tier filtering) ‚úì
- [~] Undo within 10 minutes (UI tracking only, no actual undo)

## üéØ Priority Next Steps

To fully complete the spec:

1. **Server-side automation** (spec requirement): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - ‚úÖ Auto claim extraction in edge function
   - ‚úÖ Number detection regex
   - ‚úÖ Calculate quality_score properly
   - ‚úÖ Auto-populate numeric_flags

2. **Evidence validation**:
   - Verify evidence contains exact numbers
   - Block accept if numeric policy violated

3. **Document viewer**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - ‚úÖ Page image rendering with thumbnails
   - ‚úÖ Text selection and highlighting capability
   - ‚úÖ Page navigation and zoom
   - ‚úÖ Evidence span attachment UI

4. **Bulk actions**:
   - Wire up bulk accept/reject/tag buttons
   - Add confirmation modals
   - Implement server-side bulk processing

## üìù Notes

- Most frontend UI is complete and matches spec
- Backend edge functions working but lack auto-processing
- Numeric policy is enforced in UI but not server-validated
- Export formats match spec exactly
- 10-minute undo tracks actions but doesn't reverse them
- Training examples can be created and managed
- QA generation works with manual content
